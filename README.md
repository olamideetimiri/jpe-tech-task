# Release Status Dashboard

This repository contains a small Node.js application and a simple CI/CD pipeline used as part of a Junior Platform Engineer technical task.

## The Task

Please fork this repository and work from your own fork.

Spend no more than **60–90 minutes** on the task.

Your objectives are to:

* get the application running
* review and improve the CI/CD pipeline
* make any improvements you feel are appropriate
* document your thinking and decisions

You may use AI tools, documentation, Stack Overflow, or any other online resources.

We are more interested in your reasoning, prioritisation, and decision-making than overly complex solutions.

Doing more and more things does not necessarily score higher. We are much more interested in sensible, impactful improvements that you can clearly explain and justify.

Good luck, and thank you for your time.
